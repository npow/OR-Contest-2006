\section{About ACOS}

Automatic Combinatorics and Optimization System (ACOS) is a system that automatically combines an input file and mathematical model to generate an optimal solution. ACOS targets industrial steel companies to help them decide how much input coil they should buy, how the input coil should be cut, and how much inventory should be stored in order to satisfy the monthly demand and other constraints. Moreover, it helps the companies to estimate the optimal profit within a certain period. \\ \\
ACOS is currently available on internet: http://www.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/$\sim$jnopporn/orc/ \\

\section{Mathematical Model} 
The mathematical model is implemented in GAMS format using integer programming methology.\\ 

\subsection{Variables} 

\begin{itemize}
\item $x_{i,t} \qquad$the number of input coil i purchased in month t \\

\item $y_{i,h,j,t} \qquad$the number of output coil j produced by input coil h of type i in month t \\

\item $sold_{j,t} \qquad$ the number of output coil j sold in month t \\

\item $r_{i,t} \qquad$the total number of unused input coil i in month t \\ 

\item $Out_{j,t} \qquad$ the number of inventory for type j output coil from month t \\

\item $In_{i,t} \qquad$	the number of inventory for type i input coil from month t \\

\item $BP_{t} \qquad$	the number of Bundles purchased in month t \\

\item $v_{i,t} \qquad$the number of individual input coil i purchased in month t \\

\item $z$	the total profit \\

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Equations}

\subsubsection{Objective Function}

\begin{itemize}

\item Profit: 
\begin{displaymath}
z = \sum_{t} (\sum_{j} (P_{j}\times sold_{j,t}) - BP_{t}\times C_{0} - \sum_{i} v_{i,t}\times C_{i} )\\
\end{displaymath}
The total profit for $T$ months. In each month: \\ 
profit = (total revenue) - (cost of bundles purchased) - (total cost of individual coils purchased). \\

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Constraints}

\begin{itemize}

\item Total output(t): 
\begin{displaymath}
\sum_{i,j,h} y_{i,h,j,t} \leq M \qquad \forall t
\end{displaymath}
For each month, the total number of output coils produced cannot exceed $M$. \\

\item Cut(i,t): 
\begin{displaymath}
(In_{i,t-1} + x_{i,t})\times IW_{i}\geq \sum_{j}\sum_{h} (OW_{j}\times y_{i,h,j,y})\ +\ \sum_{j}\sum_{h} (y_{i,h,j,y} \$\ (IW_{i} - OW_{j}\ gt\ L)\ -\ x_{i,t})\times L\ +\ r_{i,t}\times IW_{i} \qquad (\forall i, \forall t)
\end{displaymath}
The cutting constraint, which determines how all the input coils are cut. For all input coils, \\
(total width of input coils) $\ge$ (total width of output coils produced) + (total width lost from cutting) + (total width of unused input coils). \\
 
\item Check Waste (i,h,t):
\begin{displaymath}
IW_{i} \geq \sum_{j} (y_{i,h,j,t} \times OW{j}) + \sum_{j} (y_{i,h,j,t} - 1)\times L \qquad (\forall h, \forall t)
\end{displaymath}
Essentially the cutting constraint for each individual input coil purchased. This constraint is used to ensure that we cannot combine waste from different input coils to produce output coils. For each input coil, \\
(width of input coil) $\ge$ (total width of output coils produced) + (total width lost from cutting). \\

\item Storage Constraint A (j,t):
\begin{displaymath}
Out_{j, t-1} + \sum_{i} \sum_{h} (y_{i,h,j,t} - sold_{j,t} \geq Out_{j,t} \qquad (\forall j, \forall t)
\end{displaymath}
The total number of output coils stored in the inventory for each month cannot exceed the number of remaining output coils for that month. \\

\item Storage Constraint B (j,t):
\begin{displaymath}
r_{i,t} \geq In_{i,t} \qquad (\forall i, \forall t)
\end{displaymath}
The total number of input coils stored in the inventory for each month cannot exceed the number of unused input coils for that month. \\

\item Storage Process S (small,t):\\
\begin{displaymath}
\sum_{a(j)} Out_{j,t} \leq O_{small} \qquad (\forall small, \forall t)
\end{displaymath}
The total number of small-size output coils stored in the inventory cannot exceed the storage capacity for the maximum number of small-size coils. \\

\item Storage Process M (medium,t):
\begin{displaymath}
\sum_{b(j)} Out_{j,t} \leq O_{medium} \qquad (\forall medium, \forall t)
\end{displaymath}
The total number of medium-size output coils stored in the inventory cannot exceed the storage capacity for the maximum number of medium-size coils. \\

\item Storage Process L (large,t):
\begin{displaymath}
\sum_{k(j)} Out_{j,t} \leq O_{large} \qquad (\forall large, \forall t)
\end{displaymath}
The total number of large-size output coils stored in the inventory cannot exceed the storage capacity for the maximum number of large-size coils.\\

\item Order Constraint A(j,t):\\
\begin{displaymath}
Out_{j,t-1} + \sum_{i}\sum_{h} y_{i,h,j,t} \geq sold_{j,t} \qquad (\forall j, \forall t)
\end{displaymath}
The total number of output coils sold cannot exceed the total number of output coils that is available. For each month,(total output-coil inventory from last month) + (total number of output coils produced in the current month) $\ge$ (total number of output coils sold in the current month). \\

\item Order Constraint B (j,t): \\
\begin{displaymath}
sold_{j,t} \leq d_{j,t} \qquad (\forall j, \forall t)
\end{displaymath}
For each output coil type, the total number of output coils sold cannot exceed the demand for that type. \\

\item Input Limit A (i,t): \\
\begin{displaymath}
In_{i,t} \leq Cap_{i} \qquad (\forall i, \forall t)
\end{displaymath}
For each input coil type, the total number of input coils stored in the inventory cannot exceed the storage capacity for that type. \\

\item Input Limit B (i,t): \\
\begin{displaymath}
r_{i,t} \leq x_{i,t} + In_{i,t-1} \qquad (\forall i, \forall t)
\end{displaymath}
The total number of unused input coils in one month cannot exceed the total number of input coils available (purchased + inventory) for that month. \\

\item Bundle (i,t): \\
\begin{displaymath}
BP_{t} \times n_{i} + v_{i,t} = x_{i,t} \qquad (\forall i, \forall t)
\end{displaymath}
bundle(i,t) -- Equation representing the total number of input coils available each month (obtained from purchasing bundles or bought individually). For each input coil of type $i$:\\ (number of bundles purchased $\times$ number of input coil of type $i$ obtained in one bundle) + (number of input coils bought individually) = (total number of input coils available). \\

\item Check Width (i,j,h,t): \\
\begin{displaymath}
y_{i,j,h,t}\$\ (OW_{j}\ ge\ (IW_{i} + 1)) = 0 \qquad (\forall i, \forall j, \forall h, \forall t)
\end{displaymath}
Ensures that the width of any output coil produced from an input coil cannot exceed the length of that input coil. \\

\item Check Shave (i,j,t): \\
\begin{displaymath}
\sum_{h} y_{i,j,h,t} \$\ (IW_{i} - OW_{j}  le\ L) \leq In_{i,t-1} + x_{i,t} \qquad (\forall i, \forall j, \forall t)
\end{displaymath}
For each $i$ and $j$, if $(IW(i) - OW(j) \le L)$, then we can produce at most one output coil of type $j$ from one input coil of type $i$.\\
\end{itemize}

\section{Algorithm Description} 

\subsection{System Process Algorithm}

Clients need to submit an input file with correct format and structure, which should be similar to the example from the OR Contest web site. The system only accepts .txt or .xls type files. To submit the file, please go to 'Make a GAMS input file', and upload the correct file. In our system, it will automatically combine the source file and the mathematical model and provide a GAMS file. Clients can be easily see if the GAMS file can be successfully generated at 'Main Terminal'. Then, the client can click on the file and select 'Make an output' and the system will transfer the file to the GAMS solver and get the solution from GAMS and post it on the 'Output Terminal'. Since the GAMS solver that we are using are powered by the Computer Science Club, it is not a full licensed version. If the input data file is huge, ACOS cannot support it. The alternate solution is that ACOS will generate the GAMS file that combined the data and model, and suggest the client to submit it on any Computer Science server or NEOS Server. \\

\subsection{Mathematical Algorithm}

Although the industry standard for large scale cutting stock problem is using either Column Generation Algorithm or Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition, ACOS is running Linear Programming Relaxation of the Integer Program. The reason is that column generation or Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition are normally for one dimensional problem. In this case, it is a multi-dimensional problem with multi-input, multi-output, multi-period, multi-storage and multi-pricing model. In order to program an accurate and reliable system, we decided to stick with the 'not so' efficient LP Relaxation algorithm. It may not be efficient in terms of running time, but it is effective in debugging and fixing variations.  
The following are some specific algorithms we designed for the model. \\

\subsection{Pattern}

To cope with the problem of cutting pattern, we decided to add a subscript $h$ to represent the input coil number and the limit of $h$ is the maximum output we can produced plus the maximum inventory. Therefore, we would know how much output is produced from which particular input coil. Hence, it helps to determine how to cut the coil. \\

\subsection{Cut or Shave}

We designed the model that can decide whether to cut, shave, or shave after cutting. To do this, we implemented several conditional statements within the constraint itself. $\$(IW_{i} - OW_{j}\ gt\ L)$ means that if the input coil size minus the output coil size is greater than the loss due to cut, the system will perform a cut. Otherwise, it will perform shave. We also implemented constraints CheckShave, CheckWidth, CheckWaste to keep track of when to shave, when to cut, and when to shave after cut. Shaving input coils reduces waste, and thus gives the company more profit. \\ 

\subsection{Small, Medium and Large Storage Capacity}

We decided to distinguish the size of the storage capacity when the system reads the input file instead of doing it on GAMS, as it would more efficient. \\

\subsection{Clear Identification of Variables}
In our mathematical model, we clearly identify the varibles. For the input, we separate it to number of coil we bought, number of inventory for input coil, and number of unused input coil. For number of output, we separate it to number of output sold, number of output produced and number of output being stored. It helps us to test the system effectively and efficiently. Also, it helps the client to easily understand the problem. \\

\section{List of Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item There are only three cutting processes: cut, shave, and shave after cut.
	
	\item There are only three inventory sizes for output coil: small, medium and large.
	
	\item The coil widths are always positive integers.
	
	\item The prices for each input coil are always positive integers.
	
	\item The length of the coils are irrelevant.
	
	\item The demand forecast is correct and we do not have to always satisfy the demand.
	
	\item Once an input coil is cut, it cannot be stored.
	
	\item It is feasible to buy more in one month and save for another month.
	\item Coils do not rust while in the inventory, so they can be sold back for the same price after storage.
\end{itemize}
